# dckr

A simple shell script that lets you transparently run your project build / test / random command inside a container.

For example, assuming you have a project where you would typically run:

`ls -lA`

Just call:

`dckr ls -lA`

Without the noise:

`dckr ls -lA 2>/dev/null`

## Controlling the FROM

You can control what base operating system will be used for the container using the TARGET environment variable:

`TARGET=ults-current dckr make all`

TARGET values are visible in `Dockerfile.naked`.

## Customizing the images

You can further specialize the images by creating a `Dockerfile.THING` matching your expectations (start with `Dockerfile.naked`), and invoking dckr with the TYPE variable:

`TYPE=THING TARGET=SOMETHING dckr make all`

##Â Live containers

After the first invocation, the container is "live" (eg: kept around).

This means a couple of important things:

 * commands are cumulative... just like they are on your local copy...
 * calling on further commands is very fast (in a shell, the overhead is the cost of exec-ing and docker IO)

## How to install

`brew install dubo-dubon-duponey/brews/dckr` if you are on macOS.

Otherwise (or if you don't brew):
 
  * clone somewhere
  * add somewhere to your path.

## Gotcha

Expect running complicated shell commands to be challenging (you have to get your escaping right).

Keep it simple.

This is mostly meant to be for stuff like:

`dckr make test thingie whatever`
